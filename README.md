# Liveness_Detection

Nowadays, Spoofing is the main issue. Spoofing is cybersecurity issue when we try to make false data in use. Spoofing of human image can lead to major issues like lossing important and sensitive data. To handle this issue, we can use concept of Liveness Detection.

Here, i tried to implement the same using the NUAA imposter dataset. The dataset had around 5105 real images and 7535 fake images.

Conclusion:- Model accuracy was exceptional and model worked well on test images as well.

Restriction:- Due to lack of variety in images, model doesn't work well on Non East Asian Images. So for handling this issue, we can create a big dataset for the future projects on the Same topic.
